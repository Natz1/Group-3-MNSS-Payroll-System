# Group-3-MNSS-Payroll-System

Created user interface using ASP.Net WebForms template in Visual Studio
Languages used: C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS

To log in the system:
Employee- Email: employee@gmail.com Password: Emp123!
Accountant- Email: accountant@gmail.com Password: Acc123!
Manager- Email: manager@gmail.com Password: Man123!

Since this is an internal payroll system, I was thinking the manager would be able to add employee's emails and provide them with
a password to access the website, so there wouldn't be a registration button.

Pages for the employee, manager and accountant have been created but nothing is on them yet.
They can be found in the Roles folder for you guys to edit.
They would have the different tasks that the pseudocode involves and you would have to add graphical features like textboxes, tables and such.

Based on the account that is logged in the user would see the different option that they can do in the navigation bar.
